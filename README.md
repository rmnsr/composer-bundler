# Composer Bundler

**Composer Bundler** is a lightweight PHP web application that allows you to generate and download `vendor/` bundles from a `composer.json` file without requiring Composer CLI on your local machine.  

This is especially useful for users who cannot install Composer locally but still need to build and ship dependencies.

- Paste your `composer.json` in the web UI
- Automatically runs `composer install` on the server
- Packages the `vendor/` directory into a ZIP file
