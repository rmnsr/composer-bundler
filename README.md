# Composer Bundler

**Composer Bundler** is a lightweight PHP web application that allows you to generate and download `vendor/` bundles from a `composer.json` file without requiring Composer CLI on your local machine.  

This is especially useful for users who cannot install Composer locally but still need to build and ship dependencies.



## ‚ú® Features
- Paste your `composer.json` in the web UI
- Automatically runs `composer install` on the server
- Packages the `vendor/` directory into a ZIP file
- Download-ready bundle with autoload support
- Easy to self-host:
  - Works on any Linux/macOS machine with PHP installed
  - Can be run using the built-in PHP development server or deployed on Apache/Nginx


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements

- **PHP 8.1+**  
- **Composer** installed on the server (used by the app to generate vendor bundles)  
- Linux, macOS, or any system where `shell_exec()` can run Composer commands
